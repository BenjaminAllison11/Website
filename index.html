      <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">I'm a passionate learner driven by a desire for continuous growth and development. My journey in education has instilled in me strong persistence, communication skills, and a rapid learning ability, all of which I bring to my endeavors in software engineering.

        While my long-term goal is to join a company that fosters growth and offers opportunities to learn and evolve, my immediate focus is on contributing my skills and knowledge to a collaborative and supportive environment. I thrive in a setting that allows for both independent work and collaborative problem-solving, where I can leverage the expertise of others while also honing my ability to tackle challenges on my own.
        
        My experience in education has equipped me with valuable skills that translate well into the world of software development. Leading a class of diverse learners to success has honed my communication skills and ability to adapt to different learning styles, while overseeing their academic progress has instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and accountability.
        
        I value logic, analysis, and independent thought along with adaptability. However, I also recognize the importance of collaboration and appreciate the opportunity to learn from others. My learning style leans towards hands-on experience and active engagement, and I find peer communication and discussion to be valuable tools for solidifying my understanding.
        
        I'm excited to leverage my skills and learning agility to contribute meaningfully to the world of software engineering and embark on a rewarding career path filled with continuous learning and growth.</p>
